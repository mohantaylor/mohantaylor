Chief Technology & Product Officer @ Tenovos | Building AI-powered content solutions at scale

I live at the intersection of product vision and technical execution, architecting systems that process massive volumes of media and information across media, martech, and adtech ecosystems.

## What I'm working on
- 🎬 Large-scale, low-latency media processing pipelines
- 🤖 AI-powered content intelligence and workflow automation
- 🦀 High-performance systems in Rust
- 🏗️ Distributed architectures

## Tech I'm excited about
Rust • Microservices • Real-time Processing • Computer Vision • LLMs • Event-driven Architecture

## Philosophy
Great products emerge when deep technical understanding meets genuine user empathy. I believe in building systems that are both elegant under the hood and delightful to use.
